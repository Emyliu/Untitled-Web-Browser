# Untitled-Web-Browser

This is a personal project, where I try to replicate most of the important features in a web browser but in a lightweight way.

## What works so far
- Searching for a valid url
- Page Refresh

## What sort of works so far (barely)
- Searching for an invalid url, or putting a search term into the omnibox

## Things that will be implemented in the next few days
- Forward and Back

## Other things that will be implemented
- Favorites
- Preferences
- Tabbing
- General UI overhaul
- Naming this project
